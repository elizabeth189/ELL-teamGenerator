## ELL Team Generator

## Description

I created this app to allow users to create their own HTML document that contains their team members with easy to access information they might need! 

## Installation

ðŸŒŸnpm i;
npm run test, 
npm start

in the myTeam.html click alt+b to open myTeam.html in your local browser!

## Usage

The [repo](https://github.com/elizabeth189/ELL-teamGenerator) allows you to view the files!
You can look through the files to check out my team generator!

Here is what the test should look like:  ![Web1](./assets/images/Web1.PNG)
